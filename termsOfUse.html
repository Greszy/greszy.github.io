Swoup is not involved in the actual agreement between you and any Third-Party Services or other third parties, the terms and conditions applicable to any Coupon or Loyalty Account, the results of any Coupons obtained through the Services and Applications or any decisions made by Merchants or other third parties related thereto, any guarantees, representations or certifications made by Merchants or other Third-Party Services with respect to Coupons, Loyalty Accounts, your financial accounts, any charitable organization or any third party products, services or other offerings. <b> As such, you hereby release Swoup and its officers, directors, affiliates, employees, agents and investors from any damages, claims, actions, liabilities, losses and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) of every kind or nature, suspected and unsuspected, known and unknown, and disclosed or undisclosed (collectively, “Claims”), arising out of or in any way connected with the foregoing.</b></p>
                <p><b>b.      You further hereby release Swoup and its officers, directors, affiliates, employee, agents and investors from any Claims arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your access to or use of the Services or Applications; (ii) User Content submitted by you to the Services and Applications and any information or materials that you otherwise make available to Merchants or other users (including related to any Loyalty Account or information related to your financial accounts); (iii) your agreements with Merchants; (iv) your breach or violation of any of these Terms or applicable law, rules or regulations; or (v) your violation of any intellectual property or other rights of any third party, including Merchants.</b></p>
                <p>c. The foregoing releases are made by you notwithstanding the provisions of California Civil Code § 1542 (or any other statute or common law principle with a similar effect as to the subject matter of these Terms), which provides: <b>“A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</b> You expressly waive any and all rights that you may have under the provisions of California Civil Code § 1542, or any similar provision of the statutory or non-statutory law of any other jurisdictions, to the full extent that you may lawfully waive all such rights and benefits pertaining to the subject matter of these Terms. In furtherance of this intention, the release herein given shall be and remain in effect as a full and complete general release notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different claims or facts.</p>
                <p><b>14.    Limitation of Liability.</b> IN NO EVENT SHALL SWOUP OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACT PROVIDERS BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $500.00 IN THE AGGREGATE. THE LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.</p>
                <p><b>15.    Indemnification.</b> You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Swoup, and our affiliates and each of our and their respective agents, employees, contractors, officers, directors, suppliers and representatives, from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the Services or Applications, Content, or otherwise from your User Content, violation of these Terms, or infringement by you, or any third party using your Account or identity in the Services, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>
                <p><b>16.    ARBITRATION CLAUSE &amp; CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</b></p>
                <p>a.<b>       Arbitration.</b> YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or Applications or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.</p>
                <p>b.<b>      Severability. </b> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p>
                <p><b>17.    Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</b> These Terms, and any claim, cause of action or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms and/or the Services shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of New York, New York, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that Swoup shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
                <p><b>18.    Mobile Devices and Applications; Apple Device and Application Terms.</b></p>
                <p>a.<b>       Mobile Devices and Applications.</b> Swoup may allow you to access our Services, access or download our Applications, upload content to the Services and Applications, and receive information relating to the Services or Applications on your mobile device (collectively, “Mobile Features”). Your mobile device carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Mobile Features, and certain Mobile Features may be incompatible with your mobile device carrier or mobile device. In addition, your mobile device carrier may charge you for standard messaging, data and other fees to participate in Mobile Features. Swoup has no responsibility or liability for any fees or charges you incur when using the Mobile Features. You should check with your mobile device carrier to find out whether any fees or charges will apply, what plans are available and how much they cost. You should also contact your mobile device carrier with any other questions regarding these issues. You acknowledge that your use of the Applications is subject to any terms set forth in the terms of service of the third party providing the mobile device on which the Applications operate.</p>
                <p>b. If you are accessing the Services or Applications on a device provided by Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) or are using the Swoup App, an Application obtained through the Apple App Store, the following shall apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> i. Both you and Apple acknowledge that these Terms are concluded between you and Swoup only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for, does not endorse, and is not involved in the Swoup App; </li>
                    <li>ii. The Swoup App is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms;</li>
                    <li>iii. You will only use the Swoup App in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;</li>
                    <li>iv. You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Swoup App;</li>
                    <li> v. In the event of any failure of the Swoup App to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Swoup App;</li>
                    <li>vi. You acknowledge and agree that Swoup, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Swoup App;
                    </li>
                    <li>vii. You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the application or your possession and use of the application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Swoup, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;</li>
                    <li>viii. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;</li>
                    <li>ix. Both you and Swoup acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Swoup App, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of service which may affect or be affected by such use; and </li>
                    <li>x. Both you and Swoup acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>19.    Modification.</b></p>
                <p>a. Swoup reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms, or change, suspend or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability of any feature or Content) at any time by posting a notice on the Applications or by sending you notice through the Services, via e-mail or by another appropriate means of electronic communication. You may be required to click “accept” or “agree” to show your consent to certain amended versions of these Terms.</p>
                <p>b. While Swoup will timely provide notice of modifications, you acknowledge and agree that it is also your responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services and Applications following notification of any changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes, which will apply to your continued use of the Services and Applications going forward.</p>
                <p>c. Your use of the Services and Applications is subject to the Terms in effect at the time of such use.</p>
                <p>d. Swoup may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services and Applications without notice or liability.</p>
                <p><b>20.    Miscellaneous.</b></p>
                <p>a. Entire Agreement and Severability. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Swoup with respect to the Services and Applications, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services and Applications. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder</p>
                <p>b. Force Majeure. Swoup shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Swoup’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.</p>
                <p>c. Assignment. These Terms are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Swoup’s prior written consent. Swoup may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent.</p>
                <p>d. Agency. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.</p>
                <p>e. Notices. Any notice given under these Terms by either party to the other must be in writing by email and will be deemed to have been given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. Electronic notices should be sent to support@swoup.com. Notices by mail should be sent to: Swoup, LLC, P.O. Box 2666, New York, NY 10108, Attention: LEGAL.</p>
                <p>f. No Waiver. Any failure by Swoup to enforce any part of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of Swoup’s right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that Swoup will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms to be binding, Swoup must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.</p>
                <p>g. Headings. The section and paragraph headings in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation.</p>
