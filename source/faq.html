                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question1">How do I change how Swoup distributes my saved money?</p>
                    <p>It’s simple.  Within Swoup, go to Profile --> Account Information --> Settings and move the sliders to the new percentages for each recipient. That’s it! You just decide, and we distribute for you.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question2">I registered for Swoup Plus services through the Menu but the icon on the Menu is now no longer there. Did something go wrong?</p>
                    <p>The Swoup Plus icon appears only to the users who haven't registered for it yet. If you have registered and the icon disappeared that means you have successfully completed the registration and can adjust your Swoup account in Account Information in your profile.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question3">I authorized Swoup to make weekly distributions of my saved money but now I want to deactivate this feature and keep using Swoup only as coupon / discount tool. Can I do this?</p>
                    <p>Not a problem. Making decisions about how you use your savings is entirely up to you. We are here only to help. There are three ways to deactivate Swoup distribution feature:</p>
                    <p>1. At Profile --> Account Information --> Settings you can slide every allocation bar to zero until your ‘Keep’ bar shows you 100%.</p>
                    <p>2. On the same screen as noted above, at the bottom, you can switch the toggle to off.</p>
                    <p>3. At Profile --> Account Information --> Account you can delete your source funding bank account by sliding your finger across the account from right to left and tap the ‘trash can’ icon.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question4">How can I delete my bank information that I provided during Swoup’s registration?</p>
                    <p>At Profile --> Account Information --> Account slide your finger from right to left across whichever account you wish to delete and tap the ‘trash can’ icon. If you tap the ‘pencil’ icon, you can edit, rather than delete, your account or recipient information.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question5">Why do I have to link my bank account as a funding source and is Swoup going to have that information?</p>
                    <p>To allow Swoup to make the money, we help you save, work harder for you by distributing it to any number of selected recipients, you need to link a source funding bank account. We recommend using a checking account as your funding source account to avoid any bank fees associated with limits on withdrawals from savings accounts that your bank may impose. We need a funding source bank account because Swoup only distributes the money we save you from a source of actual money you have, not money from a credit card, which is technically not yours and which you would owe interest.</p>
                    <p>Swoup does NOT retain any of your bank account information. When you register for our services, you are actually entering in your bank details over a highly encrypted and secure system connected to our payment provider.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question6">Do I have to do anything else when it comes to selecting how to have Swoup distribute the money it helps me save? Sliding the bars just looks too easy to be true?</p>
                    <p>It really is that simple. Our goal is to make saving money through Swoup as easy as possible. Once you decide who you want your saved money distributed to, selecting what percentage you want to go to each recipient really is as easy as moving the sliders.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question7">How can I see the distribution transactions Swoup did on my behalf?</p>
                    <p>Over the course of every week, Swoup keeps a running tab of the money we help you save when you redeem a coupon/discount you found using Swoup. At the end of the week, we add up all your Swoup savings and then make a weekly distribution (on Sunday) from your linked funding source bank account to your selected recipients at the percentages you selected. To see your weekly Swoup distribution transactions, go to Profile --> Account Information --> Transactions. If you do not see a transaction, it is possible that it is still pending, so please check back. Some distributions can take up to 7 days to complete depending on your bank and the recipient. We will always alert you when we are about to make a distribution on your behalf, when the distribution is complete, and if there are any problems with your distribution. If you have any questions, you can always contact us at support@Swoup.com.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question8">I can’t find the charity I want to choose in Swoup. Why?</p>
                    <p>Not all charitable organizations in the United States meet Swoup’s criteria. Swoup uses a third party provider to filter charities across the U.S. against the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The charity must accept donations</li>
                        <li>The charity must be recognized by the IRS as a public charity</li>
                        <li>The charity must be considered a qualified charitable organization by the IRS</li>
                        <li>The charity must be in good standing with federal and state regulators</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>From time to time, we may use other criteria at our discretion. If the charity you are looking for does not appear then it is likely that they do not currently meet the above criteria. However, there are lots of charities out there that could benefit from your generosity. We encourage you to select another one.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question9">I selected a specific charity but I get communications that mention Make My Donation. Who is Make My Donation and does my saved money get distributed to the charity I selected?</p>
                    <p>In order to facilitate your donation; ensure that your grant is being made in accordance with all federal, state and local laws; and is executed in the most tax-advantaged way as possible, if applicable, Swoup has partnered with Make My Donation (MMD). Make My Donation is a 501(c)(3) Not-for-Profit Corporation overseeing its donor-advised fund. When you select a charity, Swoup first distributes your charitable donation to MMD. MMD then in turn makes every attempt to distribute your donation to the charity of your choosing. If MMD is unable, for some unforeseen reason, to complete the donation to your intended charity, we will notify you and you will have the opportunity to select another charity.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question10">Does Swoup receive a fee for distributing to a charity on my behalf?</p>
                    <p>No, Swoup has elected not to take a fee for distributing the money we help you save to a charity. However, we are not responsible for any fees collected by our partners. Please refer to their terms of service. Should you need assistance in obtaining a copy of our various Partner terms, which were presented to you during registration and to which you agreed to, please feel free to contact us at support@swoup.com.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question11">Will I receive documentation for tax purposes for any charitable distribution Swoup makes on my behalf?</p>
                    <p>Yes, on a weekly basis, Swoup will send you an email which contains the information you need to retain for your records for end of year tax purposes.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question12">How do I change or update my password?</p>
                    <p>On the main Swoup screen, tap the menu icon located in the upper left hand corner. Select profile and then Password to update.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question13">What if I don't see the area to change my password within my profile?</p>
                    <p>If you do not see a password area within your profile, then that means you registered for Swoup through Facebook and therefore we did not ask you to create an additional Swoup password.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question14">What kind of information is available to me in my Wallet?</p>
                    <p>Swoup believes in providing transparency for our users.  Information is empowering.  Within your Wallet, you can view the following information: Estimated Amount Saved Year-to-Date, Estimated Total Available Savings, Estimated Amount about to Expire, offers you have saved (organized by retailer, product category, and about to expire), and your linked loyalty program cards.  Within each section, you can also drill down into more detail on any of these views.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question15">What does “Estimated Saved Year-to-Date” mean?</p>
                    <p>Estimated Saved Year-to-Date in the stats section of your Swoup wallet is the total amount that Swoup estimates we have helped you save by redeeming offers you found by using Swoup.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question16">Can I sort the offers I place in my Wallet?</p>
                    <p>Yes, you can view by retailer, product category and Expiring.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question17">Why are the amounts in my Swoup wallet listed as estimated?</p>
                    <p>Swoup receives redemption data from our retail partners.  Sometimes there can be discrepancies so we like to say that the amount of Saved Year-to-Date and Total Available Savings are estimated.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question18">What does “Estimated Total Available Savings” mean?</p>
                    <p>Estimated Total Available Savings is the total amount of potential savings you could save if you redeemed the coupons that you have placed in your wallet.  Swoup calculates this from the face value on the coupon offer.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question19">What is the wallet?</p>
                    <p>Think of your Swoup wallet as the place Swoup keeps everything that is important to you.  It is the place to find the offers for the products you want to buy, where these offers are organized, where you can see how much potential savings you have and how much Swoup has helped you save already.  It is also the place where you can add your friends and create a shopping list to either buy online or in-store.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question20">What if I accidentally placed an offer in my wallet that I wanted to gift or discard?</p>
                    <p>Not a problem.  Simply go into your wallet and find the coupon that you mistakenly put there.  You can slide your finger from right to left across the offer and you will be prompted with icons that allow you to do other things such as place in the trash / discard.  You can also slide your finger from left to right across the offer and gift it to someone.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question21">How do I accept / place an offer I receive in my Wallet?</p>
                    <p>On the main Swoup screen, simply swipe right to place an offer you want to keep in your Wallet</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question22">Can another Swouper gift me an offer?</p>
                    <p>Yes. If another Swouper sends you an offer, two things will happen. First, if you've enabled notifications, you will receive a notification alerting you that someone has sent you an offer.  Second, when you go to your main screen, any gifted offers you've been sent will be displayed first and a “gift box” icon will appear on the coupon.  You can also filter on any offers that have been gifted to you by tapping the filter button below an offer and then tap the gift box icon.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question23">Can I gift or send an offer to a friend?</p>
                    <p>Yes, we believe sharing is caring and if you don't need an offer but someone else might, then share it. Swoup makes this easy… simply swipe up on the offer and you will be on your way.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question24">How do I discard or trash an offer I don't like or want?</p>
                    <p>On the main Swoup screen, simply swipe left to discard an offer.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question25">What if I accidentally discarded an offer I wanted to keep?</p>
                    <p>No sweat.  Swoup “keeps” discarded offers for you for up to 30 minutes after you've discarded them just for this reason.  Simply tap the filter button on the main screen, below an offer, and then tap the trashcan icon.  This will take you to Swoup's discarded view.  Once there, your discarded offers are listed from most recently discarded at the top to longest at the bottom.  Simply slide your finger from right to left across the offer, which will reveal icons representing additional options.  One of the icons is a wallet, tap that and the offer will go into your wallet.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question26">What if I accidentially discarded an offer I wanted to gift?</p>
                    <p>No sweat.  Swoup “keeps” discarded offers for you for up to 30 minutes after you've discarded them just for this reason.  Simply tap the filter button on the main screen, below an offer, and then tap the trashcan icon.  This will take you to Swoup's discarded view.  Once there, your discarded offers are listed from most recently discarded at the top to longest at the bottom.  Simply slide your finger from left to right across the offer and you will see a gift icon.  Tap it and you will be able to send to your offer as a gift.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question27">What classifies an offer as Expiring / About to Expire?</p>
                    <p>Offers with expiration dates  within the next seven (7) days are categorized as Expiring or About to Expire.</p>
                    <p class="question-bolded" id="question28">How do I add an existing loyalty card?</p>
                    <p>You can add an existing loyalty card in a couple of ways: 1. during registration, 2. in the menu / preferences section or 3. after you place seven (7) items into your wallet, if you haven't previously linked a loyalty card, you will be asked to add or apply for one.</p>
