                        <br>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><b>Allocation.</b> Swoup enables you to allocate all or part of a Swoup Savings Amount, based on percentage(s) selected by you (“Allocation Percentage(s)”), to one or more recipients (“Allocation Recipients”) chosen by you on the “Savings Allocation” screen during registration and/or from those listed on the “Allocations & Recipients” section on the Platform, and then authorize Swoup to initiate the transfer of the amounts you allocate from your Linked Bank Account (defined below) to those Allocation Recipients (each such amount an “Allocation Distribution”).</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Recipient-Specific Terms.</b>Each individual Allocation Recipient may impose their own specific terms and conditions on Allocation Distributions made to them, in addition to these Terms. By selecting an Allocation Recipient, you acknowledge and agree to such terms and conditions. Any such terms and conditions presented to you by Swoup in connection with your selection of an Allocation Recipient are deemed part of these Terms. Like other Third-Party Services with whom Swoup partners, Allocation Recipients each have their own terms of service and privacy policies. Swoup has no control or authority over any Allocation Recipients, and urges you to read an Allocation Recipient’s own terms of service and privacy policy before selecting that Allocation Recipient on the Platform and authorizing Swoup to make Allocation Distributions to them on your behalf.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Linked Bank Account Registration.</b> In order to allocate all or part of your Swoup Savings Amounts and authorize Allocation Distributions, you must first register a Linked Bank Account to your Swoup Account. For the reasons described below, Swoup strongly suggests that you use a checking account for your Linked Bank Account. You represent and warrant that you lawfully own or control your Linked Bank Account, and that you are legally able to grant Swoup the authority to initiate ACH withdrawals and transfers from your Linked Bank Account. Any agreement you have with your Linked Bank Account provider will govern your use of your Linked Bank Account. Please check the terms and conditions of your Linked Bank Account to determine if you will incur any fees in connection with withdrawals and transfers initiated by Swoup, or if you are subject to any restrictions or obligations that may prevent or hinder your ability to make Allocation Distributions.</li>
                            <br>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>Swoup urges you to register a checking account for your Linked Bank Account instead of a savings account, because, among other reasons, you may incur processing fees charged by your bank for exceeding the number of permitted transfers from your savings account. If you register a savings account as your Linked Bank Account, you acknowledge and agree that (i) Swoup will not be responsible for any such processing fees and will pass through to you any such fees incurred by Swoup, and (ii) Swoup may in its sole discretion decide to terminate either your ability to allocate Swoup Savings Amounts or your Swoup Account.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Authorization to Transfer.</b> You acknowledge and agree that by selecting an Allocation Percentage above zero for at least one Allocation Recipient, you authorize Swoup, each and every time that you enter into a Swoup Transaction, to initiate an ACH electronic transfer from your Linked Bank Account of any amounts resulting from, and in accordance with, the Allocation Recipient(s) and Allocation Percentages designated by you at the time of that Swoup Transaction, until you affirmatively end this authorization. In other words, SWOUP WILL MAKE WITHDRAWALS AND TRANSFERS FROM YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU TERMINATE THIS AUTHORIZATION BY EITHER (1) RESETTING ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES TO ZERO FOR ALL ALLOCATION RECIPIENTS IN THE “ALLOCATIONS &amp; RECIPIENTS” SECTION ON THE SWOUP APP OR (2) DELETING YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT IN THE “FUNDING SOURCE ACCOUNT” SECTION WITHIN THE MENU, (3) TEMPORARILY DISABLE SWOUP’S DISTRIBUTION SERVICE BY “TOGGLING OFF” WITHIN THE MENU, OR (4) BY NOTIFYING US AT SUPPORT@SWOUP.COM. YOU MAY CHANGE YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT BY ACCESSING THE “FUNDING SOURCE ACCOUNT” SECTION WITHIN THE MENU ON THE SWOUP APP. PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU DELETE YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT, YOUR ABILITY TO AUTHORIZE SWOUP TO MAKE ALLOCATION DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE DISABLED UNTIL YOU RE-ENTER A LINKED BANK ACCOUNT.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Current Information Required.</b> YOU MUST PROVIDE SWOUP WITH CURRENT, ACCURATE, AND COMPLETE INFORMATION FOR YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT, AND PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL SUCH INFORMATION TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENCY, ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS. YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY SWOUP IF YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT IS CANCELLED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING SWOUP OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF THE PASSWORD OR USER NAME YOU USE TO ACCESS YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION OR NOTIFICATIONS, YOU AGREE THAT SWOUP MAY CONTINUE AUTHORIZING WITHDRAWALS AND TRANSFERS FROM YOUR LINKED BANK ACCOUNT UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8(C).</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Processing of Transfers.</b>Swoup’s ability to make Allocation Distributions is powered by Dwolla, Inc. (“Dwolla”), an online payment services provider and mobile payments network. In order to use the funds transfer functionality that Swoup offers, you must open an "Access API" account provided by Dwolla and you must accept the Dwolla Terms of Service and Dwolla Privacy Policy when prompted to do so. Any funds held in the Dwolla account are held by Dwolla's financial institution partners as set out in the Dwolla Terms of Service. You authorize Swoup to share your identity and Swoup Account information with Dwolla for the purposes of opening and supporting your Dwolla account, and you are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of that data. You understand that you will access and manage your Dwolla account through Swoup, and Dwolla account notifications will be sent by Swoup, not Dwolla. Swoup will provide customer support for your Dwolla account activity, and can be reached at www.swoup.com or support@swoup.com. As is the case with any Third-Party Service, Swoup has no control or authority over Dwolla, and urges you to read the Dwolla Terms of Service (which can be found at https://www.dwolla.com/legal/tos/) and Privacy Policy (https://www.dwolla.com/legal/privacy/). You can learn more about Dwolla by visiting https://www.dwolla.com/.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Frequency and Timing of Transfers.</b> You understand and agree that Swoup may wait for up to seven (7) days before transferring Allocation Distributions to your selected Allocation Recipient(s) in one or more cumulative transfers, or longer if necessary to accumulate an amount of Allocation Distributions that is sufficient to meet an Allocation Recipient’s minimum contribution threshold, where applicable. You acknowledge and agree that the frequency or timing of Allocation Distribution transfers may change from time to time and for various reasons.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Allocation Distribution Amounts May Vary.</b> You acknowledge that the specific dollar value of Allocation Distributions may, and almost certainly will, vary, because that value in each instance depends entirely on the amount of the applicable Swoup Transaction at issue and the resulting Swoup Savings Amount realized, as well as your own selections of Allocation Percentages.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Reaffirmation of Authorization to Swoup.</b>Your failure to terminate your authorization of Swoup in accordance with Section 8(c) reaffirms that Swoup is authorized to initiate the transfer of funds from your Linked Bank Account to your selected Allocation Recipient(s), if any, on an ongoing basis. Unless and until you affirmatively (i) reset all Allocation Percentages for all Allocation Recipients to zero, (ii) delete your Linked Bank Account, (iii) temporarily disable Swoup’s distribution service, or (iv) notify us at support@swoup.com, as outlined in Section 8(c), any and all Allocation Distributions resulting from any Swoup Transactions as a result of your Allocation Recipient and Allocation Percentage selections are subject to withdrawal and transfer from your Linked Bank Account by Swoup.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Insufficient Funds.</b> You acknowledge and agree that, in the event that your Linked Bank Account does not have sufficient funds at the time Swoup attempts to withdraw and transfer any Allocation Distribution, you will remain liable for any such Allocation Distribution until Swoup makes a subsequent attempt to withdraw and transfer Allocation Distributions from your Linked Bank Account at a later date (“Second Attempt”). If your Linked Bank Account does not have sufficient funds for all outstanding Allocation Distributions at the time of the Second Attempt, your ability to allocate Swoup Savings Amounts and authorize Allocation Distributions shall be disabled unless and until such time as Swoup decides, in its sole discretion, to re-enable your ability to do so.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Changing Your Linked Bank Account.</b>You may change your Linked Bank Account by accessing the “Funding Source Account” within the Menu on the Platform.</li>

                            <li><b>Terminating Authorization.</b> If you wish to terminate your authorization of Swoup to make transfers from your Linked Bank Account, you may do so as outlined in Sections 8(c) and 8(h) above. Please note that such termination of authorization does not necessarily entail termination of the other Services. Please contact us at support@swoup.com if you wish to terminate the Services entirely.</li>

                            <li><b>Arbitration.</b> YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR PLATFORM, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or Platform or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.</li>

                            <li><b>Severability.</b> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</li>

You agree that any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms and/or the Services or Platform shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of New York, New York, and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that Swoup shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</li>
