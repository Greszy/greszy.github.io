                <h2>Swoup – Allocation Recipient Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p>Like other Third-Party Services that you may link to, access, or use through the Platform and Services, Allocation Recipients each have their own terms of service and privacy policies. Swoup has no control or authority over any Allocation Recipients, and urges you to read an Allocation Recipient’s own terms of service and privacy policy before selecting that Allocation Recipient on the Platform and authorizing Swoup to make Allocation Distributions to them on your behalf.</p>
                <p>These terms and conditions apply to Allocation Distributions you choose to make through Swoup, and are incorporated into and part of the Swoup, LLC Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”), which govern your use of the Platform and Services. All defined terms not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use. For clarity, all terms and conditions in the Terms that apply to Third-Party Services generally shall apply with respect to Allocation Recipients.</p>
                <h3>Charitable Allocation Distributions</h3>
                <p>Swoup has partnered with Make My Donation, Inc. (“MMD”), a 501(c)(3) donor advised fund with affirmative IRS determination (http://makemydonation.org/), and OrgHunter LLC (“OrgHunter”), a charity search engine company (http://www.orghunter.com/), to enable you to make Allocation Distributions to charity, and to ensure that any Allocation Distributions you authorize go only to Internal Revenue Service-qualified charitable organizations. You can find MMD’s terms and conditions here, and their privacy policy here. You can find OrgHunter’s terms and conditions here. Here’s how it works:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Designating Allocation Distributions for Charity.</b>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>If you want to authorize Swoup to initiate transfer of Allocation Distributions to charitable organizations, you can do so either (i) when prompted during your registration for Swoup, or (ii) within the “Allocations &amp; Recipients” section on the Platform, by choosing one or more specific charitable organization(s) as an Allocation Recipient and selecting an Allocation Percentage.</li><br>
                            <li>Swoup will then transfer Allocation Distributions designated for your selected charitable organization(s) in their entirety to MMD on an ongoing basis, subject to Section 2 below, and MMD will be solely responsible for disbursing such Allocation Distributions minus costs and fees (such resulting amounts “Net Donations,” described further below) to charitable organization(s). Swoup does not keep for itself any portion of any Allocation Distribution designated by you for charitable organization(s), and takes no further action with respect to such Allocation Distributions once they are transferred to MMD.</li><br>
                            <li>Please note that as required by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), MMD has exclusive control over all donations, and suggestions to MMD regarding charitable grants are advisory only. Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that (1) while MMD will endeavor to disburse Net Donations to your selected charitable organization(s), it may not be able to do so, for various reasons including without limitation: your selected charitable organization(s) (i) cannot or does not accept donations; (ii) are no longer recognized by the IRS as a public charity or have been disqualified by the IRS as a charitable organization, or (iii) are not in good standing with federal and state regulators, and (2) in the event that a suggested charitable organization does not satisfy MMD’s criteria for receiving a charitable grant or for other reasons, MMD may (in its sole discretion) substitute an alternate qualified charitable organization to receive Net Donations resulting from your Allocation Distributions.</li>
                        </ol><br>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Minimum Allocation Distribution.</b>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>MMD has set a minimum amount for donations it will accept and disburse to a charitable organization (a “Minimum Disbursement Threshold”) of $20.00 USD, and can either accept or refuse to accept Allocation Distributions below that amount in its sole discretion. This means that unless and until your Allocation Distribution(s) total $20.00 USD for a given charitable organization, Swoup may refrain from withdrawing those Allocation Distributions from your Linked Bank Account and transferring them to MMD. In that event, Swoup will continue to keep track of your Allocation Distributions and make a single, cumulative transfer to MMD from your Linked Bank Account if and when those Allocation Distributions total MMD’s $20.00 USD Minimum Disbursement Threshold.</li><br>
                            <li>If a specific charitable organization designated by you has its own minimum threshold for acceptance of donations, and your Allocation Distribution(s) have been transferred to MMD but do not add up to such a minimum threshold in a given calendar month, MMD may, at its sole option, hold such Allocation Distributions in reserve for a period of three (3) calendar months after they receive it (the “Reserve Period”). If, at the end of the Reserve Period, the aggregate Allocation Distributions to that same organization still do not exceed the applicable charitable organization’s minimum threshold, MMD may (in its sole discretion) substitute an alternate qualified charitable organization to receive your Net Contribution(s).</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Disbursement of Your Allocation Distributions.</b>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>MMD will deduct from any Allocation Distribution (i) the costs it incurs in disbursing such Allocation Distribution and (ii) a fee equal to three-and-a-half percent (3.5%) of your Allocation Disbursement net of costs before disbursing the remaining amount to a charitable organization, with the resulting amount constituting a “Net Donation”. MMD will disburse Net Donations to charitable organizations within ten (10) days of the close of the calendar month in which it receives such Net Donations, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter.</li><br>
                            <li>MMD serves as the recipient charity of record for any donation made through Swoup. You will receive a receipt from MMD after Swoup transfers your designated Allocation Distribution to MMD.</li><br>
                            <li>You may elect to stop designating charitable organizations as Allocation Distributions at any time by resetting the Allocation Percentage for charitable organizations to zero in the “Allocations &amp; Recipients” section on the Platform, or by deleting your Linked Bank Account in the “Funding Source Account” section within the Menu, by temporarily disabling Swoup’s distribution service by “toggling off” within the Menu, or by notifying us at support@swoup.com.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol><br>
                <h3>Savings Account Allocation Distributions.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Designating Allocation Distributions for Savings Accounts.</b>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>If you want to authorize Swoup to initiate transfer of Allocation Distributions to a savings account, you can do so either (i) when prompted during your registration for Swoup, or (ii) within the “Allocations &amp; Recipients” section on the Platform, by choosing “Savings Account” as an Allocation Recipient and designating an Allocation Percentage.</li><br>
                            <li>If you didn’t do so upon registration, you will be prompted to enter your online banking username and password and/or the name of your financial institution, routing and bank account numbers, and other information for the savings account into which you would like Swoup to initiate transfers of Allocation Distributions from your Linked Bank Account (such savings account your “Recipient Savings Account”).</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Disbursement of Your Allocation Distributions.</b>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Once you’ve registered a qualifying Recipient Savings Account, Swoup will initiate transfers of Allocation Distributions from your Linked Bank Account to your Recipient Savings Account on an ongoing basis. Swoup does not keep any portion of any Allocation Distribution designated by you for a Recipient Savings Account, and takes no further action with respect to such an Allocation Distribution once it is transferred.</li><br>
                            <li>You may elect to stop designating Allocation Distributions for a Recipient Savings Account at any time by resetting the Allocation Percentage for “Linked Savings Account” to zero in the “Allocations &amp; Recipients” section on the Platform, unlinking your Recipient Savings Account within the “Allocations &amp; Recipients” section of the Menu, by deleting your Linked Bank Account in the “Funding Source Account” section within the Menu, by temporarily disabling Swoup’s distribution service by “toggling off” within the Menu, or by notifying us at support@swoup.com.</li><br>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>College Savings Account and Tuition Plan Account Allocation Distributions.</h3>
                <p>Swoup has partnered with Gift of College, Inc. (“Gift of College”) to enable you to direct Allocation Distributions to pre-existing qualified tuition plans authorized by Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 529 Plans”) and/or student loan accounts (“Student Loan Accounts”). You can find Gift of College’s terms and conditions here, and their privacy policy here. Here’s how it works:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Designating Allocation Distributions for a Section 529 Plan or Student Loan Account.</b>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>If you want to authorize Swoup to initiate transfer of Allocation Distributions to one or more Section 529 Plan(s) or Student Loan Account(s), you can do so either (i) when prompted during your registration for Swoup, or (ii) within the “Allocations &amp; Recipients” section on the Platform, by choosing “College Plans/Accounts” as an Allocation Recipient and designating an Allocation Percentage.</li><br>
                            <li>Swoup will then pass certain information related to your Swoup profile and/or prompt you to enter certain additional information on the Platform in order to determine whether you have a pre-existing account with Gift of College (a “Pre-Existing Gift of College Account”), and communicate this information in an encrypted environment to Gift of College, which will use it to search its databases.</li><br>
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>If one or more Pre-Existing Gift of College Account(s) associated with you are found, Swoup will present you with an opportunity to verify your ownership of such account(s) and/or to link such account(s) to your Swoup Account in order to contribute to such account(s).</li><br>
                                    <li>If no such Pre-Existing Gift of College Account is found, or if you are unable to verify your ownership of such an account when presented, you can search for a Pre-Existing Gift of College Account by using the “Search” functionality within the “College Plan and Student Loan” option on the Platform.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li><br>
                            <li>If you would like to authorize Swoup to withdraw Allocation Distributions from your Linked Bank Account for the purpose of making Net Contributions (defined below) to pre-existing 529 Plan(s) and/or College Savings Account(s) that you select (your “Recipient College Plan/Account(s)”), you will be prompted to do so, and to enter certain information regarding such Recipient College Plan/Account(s), if you haven’t already done so during registration.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Disbursement of your Allocation Distributions.</b>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>After deducting a five percent (5%) transaction fee from each Allocation Distribution you designate for Recipient College Plan/Account(s), Swoup will transfer the remaining amount (in each case a “Net Contribution”) to Gift of College at 11:59pm Eastern Time on the Sunday following the realization of the Swoup Savings Amount resulting in the Allocation Distribution, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter, and identify for Gift of College the Recipient College Plan/Account(s) for which such Net Contribution is designated. Swoup takes no further action with respect to a Net Contribution once it is transferred.</li><br>
                            <li>If your Net Contribution meets or exceeds the minimum threshold set by your Recipient College Plan/Account(s) for individual contributions (a “Minimum Contribution Threshold”), or if your Recipient College Plan/Account(s) do not have a Minimum Contribution Threshold, Gift of College will distribute your Net Contribution(s) to your designated Recipient College Plan/Account(s) within fourteen (14) business days of receipt from Swoup, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter.</li><br>
                            <li>If your Net Contribution does not meet your Recipient College Plan/Account’s Minimum Contribution Threshold, Swoup will retain and secure that amount, and future Net Contribution(s) authorized by you for that Recipient College Plan/Account(s), on an ongoing basis for a reasonable time until they add up to an amount that meets or exceeds the applicable Minimum Contribution Threshold, at which time Swoup will transfer such Net Contributions to Gift of College, which will be solely responsible for facilitating the distribution of such Net Contributions to the applicable Recipient College Plan/Account(s) within fourteen (14) business days or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. However, you acknowledge and agree if your Net Contribution(s) do not add up to meet or exceed the Minimum Contribution Threshold set by your chosen Recipient College Plan/Account(s) within a reasonable time, Swoup may contact you with alternative options for allocating such Net Contributions.</li><br>
                            <li>If, after receiving your Net Contribution(s) from Swoup, Gift of College does not facilitate the distribution of such Net Contribution(s) to your designated Recipient College Plan/Account(s) within a reasonable time, Gift of College will attempt to refund that amount directly to you. Swoup is not responsible for issuing any refunds of Net Contributions transferred to Gift of College.</li><br>
                            <li>You may contact us at support@swoup.com for questions regarding Net Contribution(s) that have not yet been disbursed to Gift of College; however, once Swoup has transferred a Net Contribution to Gift of College, any customer service requests regarding such Net Contributions will be handled by Gift of College, and should be addressed to customerservice@giftofcollege.com. Gift of College may contact you if additional information is needed to distribute your Net Contribution.</li><br>
                            <li>You may elect to stop designating Allocation Distributions for Recipient College Plan/Account(s) at any time by resetting the Allocation Percentage for “College Plan/Account(s)” to zero in the “Allocations &amp; Recipients” section within the Menu, by unlinking Recipient College Plan/Account(s) within the “Allocations &amps; Recipients” section within the Menu, by deleting your Linked Bank Account in the “Funding Source Account” section within the Menu, by temporarily disabling Swoup’s distribution service by “toggling off” within the Menu, or by notifying us at support@swoup.com.</li>
